 
# Network Simulator 2 (NS2) Project
This is a project from my Level 3 Term 2 in BUET. It was about getting familiar with NS2 and observing the effects of modifying original NS2 parameters/algorithms.

## 802.11 and 802.15.4 Wifi Standard
Observing throughput varying following parameters:
 - Number of nodes
 - Flow
 - Packet rate
 - TX Range

## Algorithm modifications
 - Congestion window update modificaion
 - RTO calculation modification
